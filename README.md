# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using a dataset and building a machine learning model to classify whether a customer will churn or not. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to churn and develop an optimized model for accurate predictions.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Performed feature selection and feature importance analysis to identify key predictors of churn.
   - Applied label encoding and scaling techniques to preprocess categorical and numerical features.
   
2. **Model Implementation:**
   - Built multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict customer churn.
   
3. **Model Optimization & Evaluation:**
   - Used hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to ensure effective classification.

## Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation)
- XGBoost (for gradient boosting model)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
